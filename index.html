        I want to say I am , but I am not happy....I didnt have enough fun. Look theres the alone fun and the group fun. Today wasnt the group fun cause I wanted to go to galitos...so we ordered in...now even after doing that Its not like I could enjoy alone.
        I was sitting on this dining table chair not even comfortable and seeing 2.5men but I just couldnt enjoy. I tried to take some pics of that jar but I couldnt decide whether to have or not....I mean that vision of the toast and do I even deserve
        the toast? I know I do but still....that full alone , fun filled buzz I dreamt of , that was not coming. I didnt even sleep in that room so I couldnt do the recorded toast. I should save the remi martin. Rujula doesnt really bother to even talk
        to me...I mean I guess its fine she has college work too but she wasnt replying when she was online...I kinda want her to get excited about my bitsat the same way I get excited about her achievements. Oh well beggars cant be choosy. Ashwin just
        wants to meet up with me and nothing else...I mean I told him I got more work but still. Cant people just say congrats Im happy for you and that I fucking deserve this? Rujula actually did say a lot of that but I just didnt feel it was very natural..she
        even a lot less in that sweet mood than before. So you poured your heart out. Can we go to sleep now? I guess No wait. Shreyas barely talks to me. That hurts. This place was fun at first and all family and all communicating till my dad got extremely
        drunk and acted like a total fucking degenerate honestly embarassing everyone. He told everyone I took that room and threw away my parents. Others was like "these kids gets everything for so easy". Fucking no one can ever understand the toughness
        of my preparation. Then my dad was like he , my mom and grandmom have just been abhisheks workers. Itseems as a joke. But honestly , what the fuck is supposed to be the fucking joke? I would really love to know before others think "life was easy
        for me" My dad was so drunk he passed out in their house and he came home the following day. My mother asked me to express myself so I did. I said I liked the part where my father makes me look like an asshole in front of some other family. Bad
        bad idea exressiong myself As I tried to explain how bad I felt,......obviously no one understood. My mother again started fighting on the olympiad thing which made me feel like a lame peice of shit My aunt was obviously blindly supporting my
        parents My grandmother was obviously supporting my parents cause in her eyes they can never make a mistake right? The only reasonable person was my brother. Damn So first I installed ola and went down. Very hard to find auto and got one for 10mins
        away. Shreyas wore shorts lol. I made him feel as bad as possible haha. Picked him up near multi cakes. Then we went to croma and first saw gaming for a bit and then started seeing all kinds of tech. Bitches be like no heaven exists , they havent
        come here. We saw literally all products. Phones , Tablets , Desktops , AI Condoms(haha jk) , noise cancelling headphones. Then we saw a gaming section which had Lenovo Legion and HP Omen!!! Shreyas recommended HP cause its thinner. Omen was 120k
        and legion 140k. Both seemed cool deals to me. Only Lenovo had 1tb ssd instead of 512gb and also 144hz screen. Apart from that both were i7 , 16gigs ram , rtx 2060. Shreyas should control his swearing. Also we saw samsung flip phone and I held
        it for the first time in my life!!! It was so cool!!! I wouldnt reccomend for daily use though. While we were seeing samsung next gen phones some old guy came and he looked asif he was about to screw the fuck out of us. He just wanted change haha.
        Then we went to mcd like a bunch of badasses. Actually I hadnt even combed my hair and he was wearing shorts so umm 2 homeless looking guys, We acted asif were going to buy shit. We even got sanitised. We didnt buy anything and came out like a
        bunch of idiots lol. Vagabond. So all in all went in just for the hand sanitiser. lol Then I told him no , we need to reclain our honor by going back inside. We went in , this time bought 2 mcswirlys cones like a bunch of basasses. Yeah we did
        it. We went and won back the war lol. I showed him the bill carbon property. We belted the icecream where he told me about an offensive joke he made at a family event woman asks for bill shreyas: u asked for bill? woman: yes , why I cant ask for
        bill? shreyas : Today you asked for bill , tomorrow youll ask for rights Died laughing. Also 3 chicks sat opp to us and we were both getting distracted. Then he booked uber and we went home. My mom was asleep and dad was drunk and they got subway
        for me. So I went inside room , all naked cause clothes suck , geyser on , belted the sub with heat and HIMYM and it was all in all really good. Door obviously locked. Then I feel asleep by mistake. Then in my dreams or some sort of pseudo reality
        an angry figure screamed at me in my room and I woke up. God is with me. Then I took a hit , took a bath This day starteed so weirdly , hating myself for not finishing projects and all and I actually finished it all. I went out with a bro and
        did some good research. I came home and belted a nice sub which was very tasty. I took a hit. I love this stuff man. Then I took a bath. Oh also I thought about how I would incinerate aashna if I ever had the chance to. Lot of great options. I
        fucking knew this shit was impending. My mom came and told shit that Ive to fuckin start preparing for board and whatnot. She said come out of the dperession like its so fucking easy. She said theyve to inform the school that Im not going and
        shit and I just said I dont fuckin care anymore God I fucking hate these fucking people. They show no fucking regret no fucking remorse about fucking up 3 imoortant motherfucking exams and then act like fucking bosses around fucking here. When
        I get out of this fucking place I honestly dont fucking care I wont see them for months together Sleepless nights filled with indecision. Sheldon was right. My dad quickly wanted to buy ek0023tx. I fucking know , its 171 grand!! Its rtx 2070 max
        q + super. The max q makes it possible in thin laptops but redices stock performance by a little. The super is a high end 2070 variant. Battery life was 10h for video playback wow. I think this is a huge jump from en0037ax which was ryzen7+rtx2060
        and just 125k. I really like the laptop but want to wait for shreyas approval. Also hp world physical store can give it to me instantaneously whereas online takes 4-6 business days. Sadly its hard for him to rememeber many details so he asks a
        lot of repititive questions. I dont blame him its a complex story. But what really pisses the fuck out of me is him saying that even Ive fucking made fucking mistakes like my parents. I just told him on face that no Ive done nothing like that.
        Then he said that I was close with some girl in 10th and then that set in place events by which I have no friends in 11th and because of that I didnt fucking talk more and all so because of that I didnt get to know about jee. I just fucking disagreed
        that Ive made any mistakes. I mean I took the right logical decisions at each fucking step. I didnt even say bye or see you later or anything. Just left meeting. Then my dad also came and asked , why are you so depressed now? We were seeing laptops
        and all and you were happy right? I said I was pretending. My head hurt like fuck , my body too. Not taking bath had these consequences I guess One thing which scares me a lot is when I pull my hair and it hurts. It never happens when Im healthy.
        But it was paining a lot. Weak scalp? Yeah most likely. Havent wet my hair in long time. So I took a crocin and took a bath. Good thing was that in this transition weather from winter to summer lot of hot water was available. In this last year
        kvpy prep , taking showers was mostly work unlike grade 9 where it was relaxation. Today it was relaxation. We started late but even I thought nothing would happen. Unexpectedly , no stomach pain whole ride. Traffic was more than yesterday cause
        it wasnt early morning. Reached the centre at 9(just at the gate). I didnt have any isses with being let in. Then 1 min each went for restroom and finding my room number. Then I went in , I didnt realise it but I had lost at least 10-15 minutes.
        Invigilator was friendly thankfully. I went in fast took the paper and started solving without even putting my roll no , other info on the omr. I could do it when they were collecting to save time. Thats what my nigga did yesterday when he came
        late. The NSEA part was so fuckin easy man......all that hardwork seemed to pay off , except , I very soon I heard invigilator saying 30 mins left. He also told me to do the omr , so 5 more mins got lost in that. Im sure I was solving the paper
        faster than everyone. It was so easy , but I had no time. I recalled my dad at home saying , "Theres time dont worry do slow". I attempted 60 marks only......But it was so easy I could do like 100-110 man , it hurt me a lot. In the break I just
        looked at my calculator and felt bad. Then INPHO part I got the paper and filled in my roll no in the omr , just that. Then I was so demotivated that I asked invigilator if I can leave , cause in the break you can. He asked why and I told paper
        one I couldnt attempt much he went asked some people and said I wrote my roll no on the INPHO answer sheet , so I have to attempt now....he said do your best. In the INPHO part 5 qs 50 marks q1 was fuckin ammetervoltmeter error analysis. Im just
        done believein people when they said Vltmeters , Ammeters telescopes and other shit is not important , it is. Q1 was 6 marks. Thermodynamics Q2 was okay I guess. Then Ray Optics q4 I used an unconventional method , most likely wrong. q3 was a
        bit modern physics and I kind of got all answers here too , it was hard. Then q5 I did part a and e . Q5 was really hard. I spoke to neil (INAO LAST YEAR CAMP GUY)or neel or that big name guy after paper and I was really sad. No faults of mine
        and Im sad. Although even he skipped Q1. Hes just like me. The problem was that NSEP part....it just hurt. I knew If I blame my parents theyll just say one thing , their go to response , which is "You didnt want to listen" Lot of traffic coming
        back home. I didnt want to hurt my mind more so I put yt yound sheldon compilation My parents didnt tell me about KVPY so I started late and ruined it even though I studied fast. This week they didnt let me break , relax or even get my shit/feelings
        together. I was forced to go to school but still I did my best and came till here. Theyre the ones to blame for this too. PCA all 3 my plan was to study this full week , all rlc niggas took breaks most prolly for a week. Then I would have done
        both olympiads a lot lot lot better. If my parents didnt forceully send me to school depress me and break me. Thats why I had to study till late and thats why they woke me up late and here we are. The only fact that gives me happiness is that
        I went out as an underdog who didnt lose hope. I gained it late , but I fought everything. Suddenly my dad says tomorrow I have to go to school. Why? Because rajesri mam is asking. Why sudden love for her? Because itseems she was the one who requested
        principal on meet day , then my mother delivered ganeshas to her and so much so THE SOCIAL HUMAN RELATIONSHIP is getting ruined. So he doesnt care if I need a break after such a huge exam and such a big effort , but I should just go to show my
        face and shit , because she is telling and my parents relationship with her is getting ruined. And if I dont go , my dad will personally come to school and submit a letter to rajeshri mam that I didnt come for apology , because a personal human
        relationship with her is getting ruined. Then my mother said she cant write records cause its possible that on the practical exam day examiner sees that handwriting and my record handwriting and says its not matching. The game was finally ready.
        I used a date changing crack. These games have always had that "home feeling". In 9th grade so much I used to play man. It was nice reliving that spirit. I started with the north yankton mission. It was so cool. These motherfuckers , using that
        gansta (nigga) language and talking about drugs , weapons and damn!! I was enjoying. It did get annoying when I failed the mission. Im stopping now in between that funny boat mission. Its crazy I never played gta 5 story mode right? Yeah completing
        this maths lab rec. I mean what they consider math. So wnan play some young shelly with this? Dont ever call him shelly lol. I like this line from Civil War where wanda says I can't control their fear. Only my own. It kind of shows how you cant
        realy change how the majority of people feel about you (in her case scared of wanda). But when you are scared of yourself and undermining your own abilities , thats where youre in a bad position. Because youre the only person you have. Its okay
        if others hate you. But if you hate yourself when you have a choice and you can change your ways , thats where youre really broken. When I work hard I get cold feet. I used to hate it at first but now I guess I see it as sort of an achievement.
        Its nice to watch young sheldon doing this work. In experiment 9 2nd half I guess. OMGOMGOMG This is so fucking sweet where Dr. John Sturgis is explaining a unit vector to his class and then gets lost in Connie's eyes. Then he explains it 2 more
        times then shelly tells her to leave and then he explains it once again and he looks to excited and happy doing it!!! He is so in love. Reminds me of kinematics irodov Oh god finally finished 10 w/o any observations. Thatll be like whole 4 more
        experiments. Okay I dont know 4 but its a lot. I dont want to. My feet are xtra cold and my dinner is not over and its 12:30. The only good part is young sheldon. My brain feels like its swimming on some kind of strong ass drugs. The thinking
        , deep thinking was a result of it , I mean after the high atleast. Also I finished Season 1. Lol tbh I didnt start from the beginning but from the episode where John Sturgis is introduced. Some observations are left. Sleep is kind of not coming
        after that deep thinking episode but I can feel lesser reaction times. Okay I wrote most of them. Im sleepy now , but I fear terrors and not being able to get up in the morning. Doesnt help that my mother doesnt fuckin let me have breakfast in
        bed without brushing. Who even fuckin cares. Whats most important is that tomorrow theres an IOQ. I mean todays already friday cause its like 2am. I wish tomorrow was a fuckin holiday. A lot of coffee will be used. Astronomy is great okay? We
        need focus. Think about all the shit you had to go through. This is important. More than school. I know everyone has practically made you believe this is shit but its okay. You matter. Okay goodnight Ill see you later. I wish I didnt have a fuckin
        stayback. Or that lab assitant bitch would be a bitch. Is that offensive? Who even fuckin cares. Finally , Im home. Okay lets have a look at 2019 NSEA and IOQA paper. Okay NSEA looks managable , but theres a lot of Astronomy in INAO papers. Okay
        so my method will be a bit crazy , do 1 NSEA paper which should be easy. Then LEARN astronomy from INAO all past year papers. You got all night. You dont need a lot of sleep. I know that its late to start , because of well you know , but if I
        go down , Ill go down after knowing I did my best. One time physicswallah said , its not your fault if you are born poor , but if you die poor it is! Okay NSEA 80qs 3 mark each , 1 -ve which is a bit harder than kvpy. Im looking at the weightage
        but I think I should solve the paper. Got my solved paper from aakash. I thought they only produced doctors but okay. Mechanics is a good amount , I like that. This is so fucking cool. I am making a checklist of astronomy topics. Wow Im studying
        from Grade 6 ncert and teachoo haha Ive been studying hard , making a word document with my important astronomy notes which im learning from and this is so nice......I wish I could have studied more. But Im glad Im doing now. Such beautiful questions
        man. Okay Ive seen 2019,2020,2018 INAO papers , and the questions are difficult. 2019 was fine , 2020 was hard and 2018 was medium. I think this means IOQA will also be hard. Nevertheless Ill do my best. Shall I print my notes now? Its 2:20 and
        Im slightly sleepy.
