        you can contact the developer - abhishek.sensharma.2013@gmail.com , or try any of the social links at the login screen (top right corner). I would love to hear from you! Yeah completing this maths lab rec. I mean what they consider math. So wnan
        play some young shelly with this? Dont ever call him shelly lol. I like this line from Civil War where wanda says I can't control their fear. Only my own. It kind of shows how you cant realy change how the majority of people feel about you (in
        her case scared of wanda). But when you are scared of yourself and undermining your own abilities , thats where youre in a bad position. Because youre the only person you have. Its okay if others hate you. But if you hate yourself when you have
        a choice and you can change your ways , thats where youre really broken. When I work hard I get cold feet. I used to hate it at first but now I guess I see it as sort of an achievement. Its nice to watch young sheldon doing this work. In experiment
        9 2nd half I guess. OMGOMGOMG This is so fucking sweet where Dr. John Sturgis is explaining a unit vector to his class and then gets lost in Connie's eyes. Then he explains it 2 more times then shelly tells her to leave and then he explains it
        once again and he looks to excited and happy doing it!!! He is so in love. Reminds me of kinematics irodov Oh god finally finished 10 w/o any observations. Thatll be like whole 4 more experiments. Okay I dont know 4 but its a lot. I dont want
        to. My feet are xtra cold and my dinner is not over and its 12:30. The only good part is young sheldon. My brain feels like its swimming on some kind of strong ass drugs. The thinking , deep thinking was a result of it , I mean after the high
        atleast. Also I finished Season 1. Lol tbh I didnt start from the beginning but from the episode where John Sturgis is introduced. Some observations are left. Sleep is kind of not coming after that deep thinking episode but I can feel lesser reaction
        times. Okay I wrote most of them. Im sleepy now , but I fear terrors and not being able to get up in the morning.
