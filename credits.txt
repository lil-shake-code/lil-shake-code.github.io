This game is a product of depression , crippling anxiety and loneliness that makes you wish you would kill yourself.
This game is not a result of hard work / creative art. It is a result of spending time coding/drawing because you have no life whatsoever.
The main goal of this game was to earn enough money to afford good therapy. Or maybe it was to buy stuff to drown my sorrow in.
So this is what I deserve for being a normal nice guy? For trying so hard? A school that bullies you ? People who claim to be the ones to guide you setting you on a self destructive path?
Its sad that I call this progress.
Its also sad that I worked 14hour days and got bullied out of the physics and astronomy olympiad.
Now I cant go to venice and jam to ezios family :(
Well I guess enjoy every feature of the game. Its like every panic attack squeezed into a new feature
floating guns , chat , whatever the fuck
